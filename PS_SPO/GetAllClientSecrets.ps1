Use Case:  Low Trust Provider Hosted Apps or Add-ins require Client Secret, which are valid for either 1 or 3 years. Once they Expire, 
the apps will stop working and you need to generate new once for that particular appId or clientId. This PowerShell Script connects 
to Azure Active Directory and dumps all the un expired and expired/about to expire secrets and it keys. 
The appId and the secret together is sensitive information so please keep them secure and do not share clientsecret to any unauthorized users. 

Usage:
Open Windows Powershell in administrative mode and cd to the location where you save this script.
Run the script. It will prompt for your onmicrosoft account and password. Once authentication succeeds 
It will create 2 files in the same folder as below:-
Secret_Valid.txt: All unexpired and valid secrets are in Secret_Valid.
Secret_Expiring.txt: All expired and about to be expiring (10 days from the day you run this script).
